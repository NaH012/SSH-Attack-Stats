# SSH-Attack-Stats #
A simple script that will run in MOTD on a linux server and will tell you the attack statistics<br>
This will work the best if you have fail2ban and [GeoIP][geoipurl] set up and allow access to the SSH login<br>

With SSH allowing username and passwords it is a good idea to disable the root account and to allow logging in to only one account with an odd username and a very long password.<br>

I am not liable for any attempts against your ssh whether successful or not
